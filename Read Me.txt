This is the finished product of taking an estabilished XML file and turning it into an RDF/OWL project. The project took at least 15 hours with having to design the schema and then putting all the data one by one onto the project. 
The mistake made was that it was supposed to be a two part project. First we were supposed to design the schema using protege and then on another protege project we were supposed to import it and create the actual dataset. 
This product instead is both the schema and the dataset in the same file but happy how it turned out either way.
